## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by NASA. When I was younger, the NASA app used to have a feature for locating the ISS in your local sky given your location.
It would tell you where in the sky to look and at what time. I have some of my favorite memories using this feature, and wanted to do it myself 😀
